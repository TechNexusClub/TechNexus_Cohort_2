## **Repository Structure**

```
TechNexus_Cohort_2/
├── AI_ML/
├── Blockchain_Engineering/
├── CyberSecurity_Networking/
└── Software_Engineering/

```

Every track uses the same layout:

```
<Track>/
├── tasks/                 # Workshop task briefs (read these first)
├── submissions/           # Student assessment submissions
└── mentors/               # Mentor guidelines and checklists

```

### **Example layout (per track)**

```
<Track>/
├── tasks/
│   └── Example/
│       └── Day-1-task.md
├── submissions/
│   └── Example-Workshop/
│       └── Day-1/
│           └── <Student_Name>/
│               ├── <write-up>.md
│               └── <code files>
└── mentors/
    └── mentor_checklist.md

```

## **For Students: Submitting Your Tasks**

### **1. Fork the Repository**

Create a personal copy of this repository on your GitHub account.

- Visit: ++[https://github.com/TechNexusClub/TechNexus_Cohort_2](https://github.com/TechNexusClub/TechNexus_Cohort_2)++
- Click **Fork** at the top right of the page.

### **2. Clone Your Fork**

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/TechNexus_Cohort_2.git
cd TechNexus_Cohort_2
```

### **3. Sync Your Fork Regularly**

Keep your fork up to date with the main repository:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TechNexusClub/TechNexus_Cohort_2.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### **4. Read the Task Brief**

Open the task for your track, workshop, and day:

```
Software_Engineering/tasks/Example/Day-1-task.md
Blockchain_Engineering/tasks/Example/Day-1-task.md
AI_ML/tasks/Example/Day-1-task.md
CyberSecurity_Networking/tasks/Example/Day-1-task.md

```

Complete everything the task asks for before submitting.

### **5. Navigate to the Correct Submission Folder**

Submissions are organized by **track → workshop → day**:

```
cd <Track>/submissions/<Workshop-Name>/Day-<day_number>
```

Examples:

```
cd Software_Engineering/submissions/Example-Workshop/Day-1
cd Blockchain_Engineering/submissions/Example-Workshop/Day-1
cd AI_ML/submissions/Example-Workshop/Day-1
cd CyberSecurity_Networking/submissions/Example-Workshop/Day-1
```

### **6. Create Your Personal Folder**

Create a folder using your registered name with underscores:

```
mkdir <First_Middle_Last>
```

Example:

```
mkdir Bilal_Oyeleke_Soliu
```

Your full submission path should look like:

```
Software_Engineering/submissions/Example-Workshop/Day-1/Bilal_Oyeleke_Soliu/

```

### **7. Add Your Task Files**

Place all files for that day’s assessment inside your personal folder. Keep them organized and clearly named (write-ups, code, tests, diagrams, etc.).

Example:

```
Bilal_Oyeleke_Soliu/
├── unit-test.md
├── average.py
└── test_average.py

```

### **8. Commit and Push Your Changes**

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add Example-Workshop Day-1 submission for Bilal_Oyeleke_Soliu"
git push origin main
```

Use a clear commit message that includes the workshop, day, and your name.

### **9. Create a Pull Request**

1. Open the original repository: ++[https://github.com/TechNexusClub/TechNexus_Cohort_2](https://github.com/TechNexusClub/TechNexus_Cohort_2)++
2. Go to the **Pull requests** tab → **New pull request**
3. Choose **compare across forks** if needed
4. Set your fork/branch as the source and `main` on `TechNexusClub/TechNexus_Cohort_2` as the base
5. Use a descriptive title and briefly explain what you submitted

Example PR title:

```
Add Example-Workshop Day-1 submission for Bilal_Oyeleke_Soliu

```

### **10. Wait for Review**

Mentors may leave comments or request changes. Update your files, push again to the same branch, and the PR will update automatically.

---

## **Additional Notes for Students**

- Submit only inside **your own** student folder. Do not edit other students’ submissions.
- Do not modify task files under `tasks/` unless a mentor asks you to.
- Make sure your work is complete and readable before opening a PR.
- Sync with `upstream` often so your PR stays easy to merge.
- If you get stuck, ask your facilitator or mentor for help.

## **For Mentors: Managing Tasks**

See also: `Software_Engineering/mentors/mentor_checklist.md`

### **1. Adding a Task**

1. Navigate to your track’s `tasks/` folder.
2. Create (or use) a workshop folder, e.g. `Example/` or `Workshop-1/`.
3. Add a markdown file named `Day-<day_number>-task.md`.
4. Include clear objectives, instructions, deadline, and resources.
5. Commit and push.

Example:

```
git add Software_Engineering/tasks/Example/Day-1-task.md
git commit -m "Add Software Engineering Example Day-1 task"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Preparing the Submission Folder**

Before students submit, create the matching day folder under `submissions/`:

```
Software_Engineering/submissions/<Workshop-Name>/Day-<day_number>/

```

Example:

```
Software_Engineering/submissions/Example-Workshop/Day-1/

```

Students will then create their personal folders inside that day folder:

```
Software_Engineering/submissions/Example-Workshop/Day-1/<Student_Name>/

```

### **3. Reviewing Student Submissions**

1. Open the **Pull requests** tab on GitHub.
2. Confirm the path matches: `.../submissions/<Workshop>/Day-<n>/<Student_Name>/`
3. Review completeness, correctness, and clarity against the task brief.
4. Leave constructive comments if changes are needed.
5. Approve and merge when the submission meets expectations.
